I had my full theme here, but it was out of date, reduced performance a lot due to discord changes and nobody used it afaik, so I shoved it into /archive.  
I had plans on a new theme and probably will make one eventually that others might also enjoy but who knows when I feel like making it.

I'm updating the snippets occasionally.

No warranty, no promises for support.  
Any/all functionality and look of all css within this repository might change without any warning at any time.  
The Vencord plugin "ThemeAttributes" should be enabled for best experience with some snippets.  

To use the snippets:  
Grab the "raw" links to the files, example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvhhr/discordcss/main/snippets/dashless-extended.theme.css - and drop the links into your Vencord online themes.  
Other client modifications should work too for the most part but YMMV.  
**Check out the readme under the snippets directory.**  

Alternatively, you can download the file and put it in your theme folder or copypaste it into your quickCSS.  
That way you'll be able to make changes locally, and I won't be able to break your stuff but you won't get my fixes either.
